# Word Counter - JS & HTML

For this portion of the project, I chose to create a Word Counter using JavaScript and HTML. The JavaScript has functions in which I could calculate the word count and the purpose of the html file is to create a basic layout and design of the word counter. The purpose of this counter is that if you were to type in words in teh text box, the program would be able to count how many words were inputted. 

To run this project, you would simply clone the NawalNasir3.3 repository and run the HTML file. After doing so, you can click on the HTML (hold click with your mouse or left-click depending on your device) and open the HTML file with your preferred browser. 

You should be able to see this:
